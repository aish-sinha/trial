      <div class="place-info">
      <p class="info-para">Japan is known worldwide for its traditional arts, including tea ceremonies, calligraphy and <br> flower arranging.
        The country has a legacy of distinctive gardens, sculpture and poetry. <br>Japan is home to more
        than a dozen UNESCO World Heritage sites and is the <br>birthplace of sushi, one of its most famous. Despite listing some of the
        preventable crimes that can <br> or may occur in Japan, one of the primary reasons that the country is so safe is because of the <br> focus on crime prevention.
        By eliminating so called 'easy targets,' the safety of its <br> citizens and visitors can be more readily maintained.</p>
